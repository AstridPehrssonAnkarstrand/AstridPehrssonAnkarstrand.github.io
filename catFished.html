                        I wrote a novel but felt the story would be more suited in a different medium.
                        The story? A <span>romance</span> between two young adults who meet through <span>online video games</span>.
                        The catch? <span>Both</span> are <span>male pretending to be a girl</span>, desperate to keep that fact a <span>secret</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        Catfished is a solo passion-project I started after finishing the first story draft in 2019.
                        The concept is to make a <span>visual novel game</span> that takes place on a <span>computer desktop</span>, the <span>dialogue</span> being presented <span>through chat messages</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        The project has <span>helped me develop my skills</span> and <span>motivated</span> me to <span>keep learning</span> and <span>improving</span> myself both as a person and creator.

                            Catfished mainly takes place via <span>desktop interactions</span>, occasionally <span>switching perspective</span> between the two main characters.
                            The game should show an <span>approximation</span> of a <span>desktop</span> with a couple of different <span>window applications</span> displaying unique data.
                            Discord and League of Legends are the two main windows, but also a web browser.

                <div class="divide-line"></div>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    I started out with the plan of making a visual novel retelling of the story I wrote with little deviation from the source.
                    My ambition for the project, as it often does for creators, grew overtime.
                    I began imagining multiple different branches and endings, more involved interactions.
                    <br><br>
                    The main struggle was getting stuck in my own head, afraid of seeking others input.
                    Once I reached out for advice, I gained so much clarity from just trying to motivate and explain what I was trying to accomplish.
                    I was trying to find solutions to features I had tacked on, but I didn’t really need.
                    <br><br>
                    I love the premise of the game Simulacra;
                    the idea of going through someone’s device and trying to find clues about why they went missing and what happened to them is such an intriguing concept.
                    But Catfished isn’t a mystery horror game, it’s a cute linear romance story.
                    I don’t need to allow the player complete freedom and make all the apps functional with content.
                    There’s no point to it here, just more work. It would maybe increase immersion, but it would likely serve as a distraction.
                    I’m trying to tell a linear story, and that freedom would only introduce more issues I’d need to solve.
                    <br><br>
                    I’d love to tackle a game like Simulacra and the challenges that come with it one day, but Catfished is not the place for it.
                    Realizing that and accepting that has helped remove a lot of unnecessary features I deemed must haves.

                <h3>What is Fungus?</h3>
                <p>
                    Fungus is a node based visual novel plugin for Unity with all the features to create a standard visual novel.
                    I’ve created a short standard visual novel with the plugin previously.
                    A key feature I hadn't attempted was extending Fungus with custom commands using C#.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="wrapper outer">
                <p>
                    I made a desktop using UI and created my own system with logic for managing the different windows.
                    For Fungus to interact with my system I had to write custom commands that could inform my system.
                </p>


                <div>
                    <div class="container wrapper">
                        <div class="item">
                            <h3 style="text-align:center;" class="accent">Say command</h3>
                        </div>
                        <div class="item">
                            <p>
                                The most common Fungus command. Displays text in a dialogue box with a typewriting effect. By default this command awaits user input before continuing to the next command.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        <!--I wanted the wait before continuing functionality the Say command has for spawning my chat messages.-->
                        I added my own code into Fungus’ Say command so I could spawn messages.
                        The Say command takes in an optional reference to a custom dialogue box,
                        so I created different ones depending on what message type I needed to display.
                        Then in code I used that reference to determine what type of message should be sent, if any.

                        <p>
                            I disliked the look of displaying the chat message in the dialogue box.
                            <br><br>
                            After testing without it, I came to the conclusion that without was best.

                <p>
                    I made my own Say command so normal dialogue is separated from chat dialogue. This also removed the need to rely on dialogue boxes to distinguish between chat types.

                <!--<p>
                    This iteration works, the only major feature it’s missing is a solid save system.
                    I personally wasn’t a fan of creating and editing content in Fungus’ node based system.
                    It’s great for smaller projects but this bad boy was going to need a lot of text and I was already burnt out translating the first chapter.
                    I wanted to just write the story in a text editor, slap that into the game and let it run but that wasn’t possible with Fungus.
                    <br><br>
                    You can export a flowchart into a spreadsheet and edit that before importing it again,
                    but a major limitation is you can’t add or remove nodes in the spreadsheet.
                    Another concern is the export didn’t include my custom commands, which was a slight issue when about 90% of the content was using my custom commands.
                    Now I could have deep dove and tried to extend Fungus further but I didn’t really feel up to the task nor found it worth my time.
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s where we leave this one. This version also has a build, approximately the game's first chapter.

                The first verion I ever made I drew on my iPad by sketching over a screenshot of Discord.

            <p>
                Second version: I removed the server list and other unneeded details. Did keep some of the icons to fill the empty space.
                The empty headers would be populated in the engine so it could be changed dynamically.

            <p>
                For the third version I had discovered Figma and took the opportunity to learn how to use it whilst recreating the Discord layout I was now very familiar with.
                I did start to simplify areas by removing even more unnecessary details.
                I got into the habit of using a consistent value for padding and margins which made the design look more professional.
                <br><br>
                Previously the window had just been a background image with messages being spawned in but at this stage design wise for the project,
                I wanted the game to be more interactive. The player should be able to go through different chats, open and close different applications,
                so I needed to be more conscious throughout my design. This is one of the reasons I removed as many unnecessary details as possible.
                If it wasn’t interactive it was a distraction and therefore should be removed. Buttons should be consistent and clear that it was interactive.

                Forth version: I tried with rounder shapes and less outlines. Discord light is kind of cursed though.

                Forth version different color palette.
                I can’t help but find light mode Discord cursed. I’m an avid darkmode user but it turns out dark mode has some interesting design nuggets.
                Was very interesting reading up on it and learning about research on how much contrast to have between the font and the background color to make it readable.
                After that I did some of my own experiments with darker color palettes.

            <p>
                Sixth version: Up until now it’s all been fun and I’ve learnt a lot but does it actually fit the game?
                I do like the more clean digital looks of the Figma designs but my art style is more sketchy.
                I decided to go back to my roots and redraw the original style with the new simplified design.

                <p>
                    Ink is a text editor with a scripting language for writing interactive stories. Has an official plugin for Unity.

                <p>
                    With my main concerns for the first iteration being in regard to content creation and editing, I wanted to make sure that'd be as painless as possible going forward.
                    For this iteration, I wrote the content in Ink, which handles the story flow and supplies my system with the next line when prompted.
                    I do still need a way to handle that line properly. I made syntax for how to format the dialogue so I could easier parse through it in code.

                <br>
                <p>
                    I wanted the game to feel more interactive tihs time around. Allow the player to have control and ability to explore the desktop and see more of the two main characters personalities.

                            I prototyped a taskbar that the player could interact with to open, bring to front and close windows with.
                            Clicking on a window will bring it to the front. The player can also move the windows around on screen.

                    The UI should reflect my new design ideas of interactiveness.
                    I started with simplifying and removed unnecessary details if the player couldn’t interact with it or gain some information from it.

                    <br><br>
                    A struggle I had redesigning the UI was balancing aspects of the original with a consistent design for my game.
                    I wanted to keep the original’s more unique aspects so it's still recognizable but it shouldn’t be a rip-off.

                    I learnt a lot about project structure and got more advanced with how I handled the UI.
                    The previous version was static whilst the current one can be rescaled if needed. I also added more animations and features to this one.
                    The windows work and can display information properly. There’s also a basic dialogue box functionality working.
                    What’s missing is the basic visual novel features for later in the story when I want to display character portraits.
