                        I wrote a short novel that I'm quite fond of but felt the story would be more suited for a different medium.
                        The story? A romance featuring two young adult guys who meet through video games and start developing a close relationship.
                        The catch? Both are pretending to be a girl and desperate to keep that fact a secret.
                        <br><br>
                        Catfished is a solo passion-project I started after finishing the first story draft in 2019.
                        The core concept is to make a visual novel style game that takes place on a computer desktop.
                        <br><br>
                        Being a long lived project, it has seen many iterations and versions.
                        Remaking it in any new software I’m trying has become a bit of a habit of mine.
                        It's a fairly effective way to learn though, doing something familiar in an unfamiliar tool.
                        It’s helped me build a lot of the UI habits I have and motivated me to keep learning and improving myself both as a person and creator.
                        I genuinely love creating.

                            Catfished mainly takes place via desktop interactions, switching perspective between the two main characters.
                            I need to show an approximation of a desktop with a couple of different windows showing unique data for that window.
                            Discord and League of Legends are the two main windows, but also a web browser.

                <p>
                    I started out with the plan of making a visual novel retelling of the story I wrote with little deviation from the source.
                    My ambition for the project, as it often does for creators, grew overtime.
                    I began imagining multiple different branches and endings, more involved interactions.
                    <br><br>
                    One of my biggest struggles was getting stuck in my own head, afraid of seeking others input.
                    Once I actually reached out for advice I gained so much clarity from just trying to motivate and explain what I was trying to accomplish.
                    I was trying to find solutions to features I had tacked on but I didn’t really need.
                    <br><br>
                    I love the premise of the game Simulacra;
                    the idea of going through someone’s device and trying to find clues about why they went missing and what happened to them is such an intriguing concept.
                    But Catfished isn’t a mystery horror game, it’s a cute linear romance story.
                    I don’t need to allow the player complete freedom and make all the apps functional with content.
                    There’s no point to it here, just more work. It would increase immersion maybe but it would most likely only serve as a distraction.
                    I’m trying to tell a linear story and that freedom would only introduce more issues I’d need to solve.
                    <br><br>
                    I’d love to tackle a game like Simulacra and the challenges that come with it one day, but Catfished is not the place for it.
                    Realizing that and accepting that has helped remove a lot of unnecessary features I deemed must haves.

                    The project can be broken down into 3 distinct iterations, the earlier 2 developed in Unity whilst the current one in Unreal Engine 5.
                    Alongside that there’s the UI design journey that has taken place overtime.
                    To structure this page I’ll break it into 3 different sections: Fungus + Unity iteration, Ink + Unity iteration and Unreal Engine iteration.
                    Fungus and Ink will make sense later.

                <div class="wrapper">
                    <h3>What is Fungus?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fungus is a node based visual novel plugin for Unity with great documentation and practically all the features needed to create a standard visual novel.
                        I’ve created a more standard visual novel with the plugin previously so I’m familiar with it.
                        A key feature I hadn't attempted before was extending Fungus with my own commands using C#.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="divide-line"></div><br><br>
                <h3>Desktop?</h3>
                <p>
                    To simulate a desktop I built the windows with UI and developed a system to handle updating the windows.
                    I wrote the game's content in Fungus, but in order for Fungus to interact with my system I had to create custom commands.
                </p>

                <h3>Say command</h3>
                <p>
                    Getting content from Fungus to my system in order to spawn in chat messages was more of a challenge to integrate. One of the most used Fungus commands is the Say command,
                    which displays dialogue in a dialogue box with a typewriting effect. By default this command waits for user input before continuing to the next command.
                    I wanted this delay until input between each message but didn’t know how to do this on my own. Instead, I added my own code into Fungus’ Say command.

                    <br><br>
                    The Say command can take in a reference to a custom dialogue box,
                    so I created different ones depending on what message type I needed to display.
                    Then in code I used that reference to determine what type of message should be sent, if any.
                    A side effect of this was that every message got displayed as a dialogue box.
                </p>

                <h3 style="text-align:center;">Removing the dialogue box</h3>
                <p>
                    I made unique dialogue boxes to match the window it came from but after implementing it and playtesting I found it odd.
                    It was distracting, acting like a magnifying glass on the latest message.
                    The window with the messages is already there so it feels unnecessary displaying it twice.
                    I quickly hacked a test solution of hiding the dialogue box by lowering the UI’s opacity.
                    I found this to work better and though the solution works it isn’t a very clean approach.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to take on the task of making my own Say command so normal dialogue is separated from chat dialogue.
                    I created the Chat command by duplicating the Say command and removing unneeded code.
                    I then coded a custom editor for the command so I could toggle what variables to show based on the context of what chat type it was.

                <p>
                    I also decided to remake the art assets so there was some design thought put into it. I removed a lot of unnecessary details as I wanted it to be more readable and simplified.

                <h2 style="text-align:center;">Concluding the first iteration</h2>

                <br>
                <p>
                    This iteration works, the only major feature it’s missing is a solid save system.
                    I personally wasn’t a fan of creating and editing content in Fungus’ node based system.
                    It’s great for smaller projects but this bad boy was going to need a lot of text and I was already burnt out translating the first chapter.
                    I wanted to just write the story in a text editor, slap that into the game and let it run but that wasn’t possible with Fungus.
                    <br><br>
                    You can export a flowchart into a spreadsheet and edit that before importing it again,
                    but a major limitation is you can’t add or remove nodes in the spreadsheet.
                    Another concern is the export didn’t include my custom commands, which was a slight issue when about 90% of the content was using my custom commands.
                    Now I could have deep dove and tried to extend Fungus further but I didn’t really feel up to the task nor found it worth my time.
                    <br><br>
                    And that’s where we leave this one. This version also has a build, approximately the game's first chapter.

            The first verion I ever made I drew on my iPad by sketching over a screenshot of Discord.
        </p>

        <img src="images/catfished/Discord_V1.png" alt="Discord Version 1" width="1289" height="775" class="center">
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Second version: I removed the server list and other unneeded details. Did keep some of the icons to fill the empty space.
            The empty headers would be populated in the engine so it could be changed dynamically.
        </p>
        <img src="images/catfished/Discord_V2.png" alt="Discord Version 2" width="1290" height="779" class="center">

        <br><br>
        <p>
            For the third version I had discovered Figma and took the opportunity to learn how to use it whilst recreating the Discord layout I was now very familiar with.
            I did start to simplify areas by removing even more unnecessary details.
            I got into the habit of using a consistent value for padding and margins which made the design look more professional.
            <br><br>
            Previously the window had just been a background image with messages being spawned in but at this stage design wise for the project,
            I wanted the game to be more interactive. The player should be able to go through different chats, open and close different applications,
            so I needed to be more conscious throughout my design. This is one of the reasons I removed as many unnecessary details as possible.
            If it wasn’t interactive it was a distraction and therefore should be removed. Buttons should be consistent and clear that it was interactive.

            Forth version: I tried with rounder shapes and less outlines. Discord light is kind of cursed though.

            Forth version different color palette.
            I can’t help but find light mode Discord cursed. I’m an avid darkmode user but it turns out dark mode has some interesting design nuggets.
            Was very interesting reading up on it and learning about research on how much contrast to have between the font and the background color to make it readable.
            After that I did some of my own experiments with darker color palettes.

            Sixth version: Up until now it’s all been fun and I’ve learnt a lot but does it actually fit the game?
            I do like the more clean digital looks of the Figma designs but my art style is more sketchy.
            I decided to go back to my roots and redraw the original style with the new simplified design.

            Seventh version: I used the previous version as a template and drew over it, creating a sketchy version to use in the engine.

                    <h3>What is Ink?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ink is a text editor with a scripting language for writing interactive stories. It has an official plugin for Unity.
                        The plan was similar to the Fungus iteration, just replacing Fungus with Ink.

                <h3 style="text-align:center;">Dialogue Parsing</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For this new system, I wrote the content in Ink, which manages the story flow and supplies the game manager with the next line when prompted.
                    I do still need a way to handle that line properly. I made syntax for how to format the dialogue so I could easier parse through it in code.

                <h3 style="text-align:center;">Increase interactiveness</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My vision for the game had changed, I wanted the game to be more immersive and interactive, less visual novel.
                    To do this I gave the player more freedom, letting them control the windows instead of the system doing it.
                    I prototyped a taskbar that the player could interact with to open, bring to front and close windows with.
                    Clicking on a window will bring it to the front. The player can also move the windows around.
                    In order for all the windows to be able to do this I used inheritance.
                    The base window class holds the code for moving around and communicates with a Desktop manager on being placed in front.
                </p>

                <h3>UI development in Figma</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The UI should reflect my new design ideas of interactiveness.
                    I started with simplifying and removed unnecessary details if the player couldn’t interact with it or gain some information from it.
                    A struggle I had redesigning the UI was balancing aspects of the original with a consistent design for my game.
                    I wanted to keep the original’s more unique aspects so it's still recognizable but it shouldn’t be a rip-off.

                <br>
                <p>
                    I learnt a lot about project structure and got more advanced with how I handled the UI.
                    The previous version was static whilst the current one can be rescaled if needed. I also added more animations and features to this one.
                    The windows work and can display information properly. There’s also a basic dialogue box functionality working.
                    What’s missing is the basic visual novel features for later in the story when I want to display character portraits.
                    <br><br>
                    This iteration doesn’t have a build.
