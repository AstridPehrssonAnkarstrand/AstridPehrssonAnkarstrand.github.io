        <h1>Implementation</h1>

        <p>
            I learnt about using CSV-files to import data into data tables in Unreal Engine.
            All the games dialogue comes from Data tables that I manaually imported as a CSV file to Unreal Engine.
            I couldn't find a easy way to get the data automatically from a live Google sheets document in without a plugin or C++.
            I might return to the topic in more detail in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Mode</h2>
        <p>
            The game mode has two actor components, one for the data and the other for parsing the data.
            The parse component doesn't contain any data of its own, it just handles data given to it and parses it into the appropriate format.
            The game mode has functions for continuing dialogue, if that isn't possible the story will be continued instead.
            <br>
            For handling the story I have one story skeleton that informs what dialogue should come next in the story.
            The story skeleton is a data table that stores references to the dialogue data and what chatroom ID it should be added to.
            If the chatroom ID doesn't exist a new one will be created by the data actor component.
            The dialogue is also a data table, one data table per conversation, where a row represents one dialogue line.
            This could use some more clarification so see below a more indept description on how the data table is set up.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Dialogue Data (Expandable)</h3>
        <p>
            I took inspiration from how Honkai Stair Rail writes their dialogue, as I found a good guide on Wikipedia explaining it.
            To explain the dialogue syntax a bit.
            <br>
            The ID needs to be unique as it will be the Data tables row name in Unreal.
            In the prototype I used the element index but for an actual production a more advanced ID would most likely be needed.
            <br>
            The indent informs what level the story is at. Used after dialogue choice to branch the story.
            <br>
            IsExtend is a bool that informs if the dialogue comes from the same sender as the previous one.
            This changes the message widgets margin and if it's not the player wether their name is shown.
            <br>
            The sender will be the name that is displayed. It is also used as an ID for getting the message material.
            A message from the player should use the syntax (Me) instead.
            If the player should be able to select a reply, the syntax is {Choice}. The choice selected by the player will be sent as a message by default.
            The default can be overriden by using the syntax {Choice|True}.
            This could be useful for summarizing a choice and then sending the actual longer messages after.
            <br>
            Then there's the dialogue line itself. There is some text styling that can be done here.
            The normal <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b> is one. Note that because of Unreal being Unreal, style notations can't be nested.
            You need to end the previous one before starting a new one which is a bit tedious. A line break is also possible.
            I also added emojis, but they're using a different font so need to be wrapped with style notation as well. I currently have option for text sized emojis, fontsize 48 and 68.
            The two latter looks best if it's only an emoji and no text, as the emojis will change the font height and therefor leave unwanted gaps.

        <h2>HUD-class</h2>

        <h2>Widgets</h2>

        <p>
            I knew I wanted multiple different chatrooms that the player can read through but wasn't sure on how to structure it.
            I could have one chatroom widget and update it's contents based on which chatroom is currently open, or multiple chatrooms and just hide the unopen ones.
            I chose the second approach, that way the chatroom could still get updated when not open and I wouldn't have to handle saving and reapplying different chatroom states and data.
