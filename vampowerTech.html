                                I created a <span>versatile health system</span> in blueprints that was <span>reused</span> for all the prototypes, <span>saving on development time</span> to work on other features.

                                To test the health system, I made a <span>target dummy</span> with the health system properly implemented with a <span>health bar</span> to visualize the current health.
                                <br><br>
                                To deal damage I made an <span>attack actor component</span> that can be applied to any actor and a <span>turret that shoots projectiles</span>.

                        I made 2 blueprint classes, the BP_SpawnManager and BP_Spawner.
                        The SpawnManager listens to events from the day/night system to know when to start spawning and the day count to get spawn data.
                        The SpawnManager then gives the spawn data to the needed spawners and tell them to start spawning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The enemy spawning does not utilize <span>object pooling</span> so the later days, 10 and up, do start impacting performance negatively.
                        If the team were to publish the game properly, I'd work on implementing object pooling.

                    <p>
                        For us designers to have full control of each wave, I made a data table to specify; where to spawn, what to spawn, the amount to spawn, the delay until next spawn.
                        Each data table row contains the spawn content for 1 day. The data table is built using 3 structs.

                <h3>HUD-CLASS</h3>
                <div class="divide-line"></div>
                <p>
                    For this project I tried a new approach for managing widgets. I decided to use the HUD-class to <span>create</span> and <span>handle</span> all the <span>widgets</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    I really like this approach, as it centralizes everything UI related in one place,
                    making it easier to manage and for others to work around.
                    For information other systems needed from the UI,
                    I created <span>event dispatchers</span> that the widgets trigger.
                    Example: when an upgrade is purchased from the shop widget, the player blueprint listens to the event dispatcher so it can apply the needed changes.
                    <br><br>
                    Another new approach I tried for this project was to <span>keep gameplay logic out of the widgets</span>.
                    The widgets should only <span>display given data</span> and <span>forward button inputs</span>.
                    When button input is received the widget fires an <span>event dispatcher</span> so the <span>HUD-class can handle it</span>.

                            <p>
                                <span>After building a structure</span> there was a noticeable <span>delay before</span> you could <span>interact with another node</span>.
                                After debugging I still couldn't figure it out, so I ended up rewriting how the click interact works in hopes of fixing it, but the delay was still there. As it wasn't game breaking I had to leave it.
                                <br><br>
                                I ended up accidentally <span>solving</span> it when I was fixing a similar hover bug, but over UI weapon icons on the HUD.
                                Turns out it had to do with <span>changing Input mode when exiting menus</span>.
                                Previously I just set it to <span>Input Mode Game Only</span> whenever exiting a menu but <span>using Input Mode UI And Game</span> instead just… <span>solved it</span>. Good to know. :)

                            <p>
                                There was a lot of <span>inconsistency</span> with clicking on the <span>resource node</span>. This led to some <span>frustration and confusion from play testers</span>.

                                The <span>reason</span> for this inconsistency was <span>other objects blocking the raycast</span> from the cursor.
                                <br>
                                When rewriting the click interact, I <span>added a object channel for Interact</span>, which helped reduce the inconsistency.

                            To improve the user experience, I added more <span>feedback to the players actions</span>. I <span>swap the cursor icon</span> and add a <span>hover effect</span> on the resource node by changing the material.
                            This makes the resource nodes feel more like <span>buttons</span> and helps <span>inform that the player should click on it</span>.
                            <br><br>
                            The resource nodes were sometimes <span>missed</span> so I very subtly added <span>animated arrows</span> pointing at the resource nodes.
                            <br><br>
                            The hover effects and arrows are <span>only active during nighttime</span> when they are interactable.

                    Scaling is a big part of any survival-like game. As the player gets stronger, resources get sparser and enemies tougher or increase in amount.
