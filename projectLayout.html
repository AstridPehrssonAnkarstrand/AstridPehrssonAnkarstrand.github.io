                    The concept was definitely overscoped for the short timeframe but even so we pulled through and made a fun and replayable game.
                    I developed new habits that I feel will greatly improve my workflow in the future.

                        The blockout helps inform the structure of the widgets and what content I'll need.

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Inspiration & research</h3>
        <p>
            I took inspiration from games in the survival-like genre for the UI. The main ones were Brotato, Soulstone Survivor, the League of Legends gamemode Swarm and a non survival-like Thronefall.
            Brotato was used as reference for the layout, particularly the weapon and item shop before you start a wave.
            Soulstone Survivor was used for the overall aesthetics and the HUD layout.
            The League of Legends temporary gamemode Swarm was mainly used as inspiration for how to word skills and item descriptions.
            Thronefall had a big influence on both the project's design and the UI. The hold to start night mechanic is one example and the minimalist UI design for menus is another.

        <div class="wrapper bg1">
            <h2 style="text-align:center;">HUD-class</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The HUD-class creates and handles all the widgets logic, only exception is the in world healthbars.
                I really like this approach, as it centralizes everything UI related in one place,
                making it easier to manage and for others to work around.
                For information other systems needed from the UI,
                I created Event dispatchers in the HUD-class that the widgets triggered.
                Example; when an upgrade is purchased from the shop widget that the player blueprint listens to in order to apply the changes.
                <br><br>
                For this project I tried to keep gameplay logic out of the widgets.
                I only wanted the widgets to take in data, display it and handle UI related player input.
                When UI input is received the widget would fire an event dispatcher so the HUD-class would be informed and handle it.

    <br><br>
    <p>
        For the upgrade cards I had a lot of references to go from.
        The difficult part was figuring out how to place the current player information. Their weapons, their stats and upgrades.
        I got stuck moving things around but didn't find something I was satisfied with it.

    <h5 style="text-align:center;">Reimagined blockout</h5>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now having taken time away from the project, I tried tackling the main issues I had with the layout.
        I feel the previous one has too much information packed into one big blob that takes up a third of the screen.
        It’s overwhelming and doesn’t look good.
        To solve this I kept the weapon and upgrade icons but moved the other information into tooltips.
        This gives a lot more space and allows me to make the container shorter and the icons could potentially be made even smaller if needed.
        I also moved the active heart up to the top of the screen, as it was very awkwardly placed with the upgrades prior.

                        Playtesters often missed the tab buttons, unless they accidentally hovered over them and realized they’re buttons.
                        Curiously, the same button design and layout is used in the select menu for character select but doesn't have the same issue.
                        The select menu has a Header text right under the buttons displaying what tab is currently open.
                        I’d be curious to see if adding that to the builds menu would help alleviate the problem.
                        Otherwise I’d work on clarifying the tab buttons visual language to more clearly communicate to the player that they are in fact buttons.

                        The choice of red for the currency text made some playtesters believe they couldn’t afford to purchase a structure even though they could.
                        From a UX stand point red is often used to communicate an error or lack of resources in this context.
                        Knowing this I made a visual distinction between elements when an element can’t be afforded by lowering the opacity.
                        Unfortunately, this difference doesn’t matter if all the structures can be afforded.
                        They all look the same so it’s easy to make the assumption that you can’t afford any of them.
                        I should have done a better job communicating this visually or picked a more conventional color for better UX.

                        <span>Same design</span> is used in the class select menu but <span>not the same issue</span>.
                        Difference is it has a <span>Header text</span> right under the buttons.
                    </p>

                        I’d be curious to see if adding that to the builds menu would help alleviate the problem.
                        <br><br>
                        Otherwise I’d work on <span>clarifying</span> the tab buttons <span>visual language</span> to more <span>clearly communicate</span> to the player that they are in fact buttons.

                    <p>
                        The <span>red color</span> for the <span>currency text</span> gave playtesters the <span>impression</span> that an <span>item they could afford wasn't purchasable</span>.

                        From a UX stand point <span>red</span> is used to <span>communicate an error</span> or <span>lack of resources</span> in this context.
                        <br><br>
                        Knowing this I made a <span>visual distinction between elements</span> when an element can’t be afforded by lowering the opacity.

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, this <span>distinction isn't there when all the elements can be afforded</span>, leading to the <span>assumption that you can’t purchase it</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        I should have done a better job communicating this visually or picked a more conventional color for better UX.

                        The select menu does not have a blockout,
                        but was instead made in engine by taking standards I’d made for the earlier menus.
                        I reused widgets whenever possible, for example the heart select cards are repurposed build structure cards.

                        For the final version of the game the <span>main menu</span> was separated out from the selection menu and put in its <span>own level</span>.
                        This made map selection and restarting a level a lot simpler.

                        The <span>layout</span> was also changed to be horizontal instead of vertical, inspired by the menus in <span>Thronefall</span>. I setup a quick scene to use as backdrop and added a title.

                        In total I made 10 different Heart types, but to fit them all I had to <span>update the design</span> of the <span>Heart select cards</span>.

                        The <span>Quick play button</span> was added to speedup getting into game, useful when <span>debugging</span>. 
                        It picks all the default options, <span>skipping the selection process</span> getting you <span>into the game with one click</span>.
                        <br>

                        I've experience doing a <span>visual novel style game</span> in Unreal Engine so I repurposed some of that code to work for a cutscene.
                        <br><br>
                        The cutscene widget takes <span>two arrays</span> of the <span>same length</span>, one for <span>images (texture2D)</span> and one for <span>string</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        The widget goes through the arrays, <span>changing the image</span> and displaying the <span>string</span> with a <span>typing effect</span>.
                        When the full string is displayed there's a <span>short delay</span> before <span>automatically continuing</span> to the next element.
                        <br><br>
                        The player can <span>click to continue</span> the story quicker.
                        To handle this input I made an <span>invisible button</span> that <span>covers the entire screen</span>.
