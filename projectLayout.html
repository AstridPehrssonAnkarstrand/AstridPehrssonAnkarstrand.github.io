            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Inspiration & research</h3>
            <p>
                I took inspiration from games in the survival-like genre for the UI. The main ones were Brotato, Soulstone Survivor, the League of Legends gamemode Swarm and a non survival-like Thronefall.
                Brotato was used as reference for the layout, particularly the weapon and item shop before you start a wave.
                Soulstone Survivor was used for the overall aesthetics and the HUD layout.
                The League of Legends temporary gamemode Swarm was mainly used as inspiration for how to word skills and item descriptions.
                Thronefall had a big influence on both the project's design and the UI. The hold to start night mechanic is one example and the minimalist UI design for menus is another.

                            The shop has a <span>randomness</span> to what cards get displayed. There should be a <span>reroll feature</span> to reroll the shops selection.
                            A feature to <span>lock/ unlock</span> individual cards so the player has the option to <span>not reroll locked cards</span>.
                            The player should also be able to see their <span>current stats</span> and <span>purchased upgrades</span> to <span>informed choices</span>.

                        <h4>Original block out</h4>
                        <p>
                            For the <span>upgrade cards</span> I had a lot of references to go from. The main inspirations were <span>Brotato</span> and <span>Soulstone Survivor</span> for their layouts.
                            <br><br>
                            The <span>difficulty</span> I faced was figuring out the <span>placement of player information</span>, such as their weapon(s), stats and upgrades.
                            I ended up dissatisfied with what I came up with but knew I didn't have the time to fix it.
                            <br><br>
                            The <span>main issues</span> I have with it is that there's <span>too much packed information</span> that takes up a third of the screen.
                            It feels <span>overwhelming</span> and doesn’t look clean.

                            Taken time away from the project, I tried <span>tackling the main issues</span> I had with the original layout.
                            <br><br>
                            To solve how crowded it felt I <span>moved information into tool tips</span>, only keeping the <span>icons</span> for the weapon and upgrades.
                            This gives a lot <span>more space</span> and allows me to make the <span>container shorter</span>. The icons could potentially be made even smaller if needed.
                            <br><br>
                            I also moved the active heart up to the top of the screen, as it was oddly placed with the upgrades prior.

                        I’d be curious to see if adding that to the build's menu would help alleviate the problem.
                        Otherwise, I’d work on <span>clarifying</span> the tab buttons <span>visual language</span> to more <span>clearly communicate</span> to the player that they are in fact buttons.

                                The <span>red color</span> for the <span>currency text</span> gave play testers the <span>impression</span> that an <span>item they could afford wasn't purchasable</span>.
                                From a UX standpoint <span>red</span> is used to <span>communicate an error</span> or <span>lack of resources</span> in this context.

                                Knowing this I made a <span>visual distinction between elements</span> when an element can’t be afforded by lowering the opacity.

                            </p>

                                Unfortunately, this <span>distinction isn't there when all the elements can be afforded</span>, leading to the <span>assumption that you can’t purchase it</span>.
                                I should have done a better job communicating this visually or picked a more conventional color for better UX.

                            It was made in engine by taking standards I’d made for the earlier menus.

                            For the final version of the game the <span>main menu</span> was separated out from the selection menu and put in its <span>own level</span>.
                            This made map selection and restarting a level a lot simpler.

                            The <span>layout</span> was also changed to be horizontal instead of vertical, inspired by the menus in <span>Thronefall</span>. I setup a quick scene to use as backdrop and added a title.

                            I've experience doing a <span>visual novel style game</span> in Unreal Engine, so I repurposed some of that code to work for a cutscene.
                            <br><br>
                            The cutscene widget takes <span>two arrays</span> of the <span>same length</span>, one for <span>images (texture2D)</span> and one for <span>string</span>.
                            <br><br>
                            The widget goes through the arrays, <span>changing the image</span> and displaying the <span>string</span> with a <span>typing effect</span>.
                            When the full string is displayed there's a <span>short delay</span> before <span>automatically continuing</span> to the next element.
                            <br><br>
                            The player can <span>click to continue</span> the story quicker.
                            To handle this input, I made an <span>invisible button</span> that <span>covers the entire screen</span>.

                <p>
                    I made 2 blueprint classes, the BP_SpawnManager and BP_Spawner.
                    The SpawnManager listens to events from the day/night system to know when to start spawning and the day count to get spawn data.
                    The SpawnManager then gives the spawn data to the needed spawners and tell them to start spawning.

                <p>
                    The enemy spawning does not utilize <span>object pooling</span> so the later days, 10 and up, do start impacting performance negatively.
                    If the team were to publish the game properly, I'd work on implementing object pooling.

                    For us designers to have full control of each wave, I made a data table to specify; where to spawn, what to spawn, the amount to spawn, the delay until next spawn.
                    Each data table row contains the spawn content for 1 day. The data table is built using 3 structs.

                <div class="divide-line"></div>
                <p>
                    For this project I tried a new approach for managing widgets, as I knew this game would have a lot of menus.
                    After learning some more best practices I decided to use the HUD-class.
                    The HUD-class <span>creates</span> and <span>handles</span> all the <span>widgets</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    I really like this approach, as it centralizes everything UI related in one place,
                    making it easier to manage and for others to work around.
                    For information other systems needed from the UI,
                    I created <span>event dispatchers</span> that the widgets triggered.
                    Example: when an upgrade is purchased from the shop widget that the player blueprint listens to in order to apply the changes.
                    <br><br>
                    Another new approach I tried for this project was to <span>keep gameplay logic out of the widgets</span>.
                    The widgets should only <span>display given data</span> and <span>forward button inputs</span>.
                    When button input is received the widget fires an <span>event dispatcher</span> so the <span>HUD-class can handle it</span>.
                </p>

                            The player <span>walks up to the resource node</span> to <span>interact</span> with it.
                            This was extremely <span>tedious and time consuming</span>.

                    <h5>1. Delayed interact after purchase</h5>
                    <p>
                        <span>After building a structure</span> there was a noticeable <span>delay before</span> you could <span>interact with another node</span>.
                        After debugging I still couldn't figure it out, so I ended up rewriting how the click interact works in hopes of fixing it, but the delay was still there. As it wasn't game breaking I had to leave it.
                        <br><br>
                        I ended up accidentally <span>solving</span> it when I was fixing a similar hover bug, but over UI weapon icons on the HUD.
                        Turns out it had to do with <span>changing Input mode when exiting menus</span>.
                        Previously I just set it to <span>Input Mode Game Only</span> whenever exiting a menu but <span>using Input Mode UI And Game</span> instead just… <span>solved it</span>. Good to know. :)

                    <p>
                        There was a lot of <span>inconsistency</span> with clicking on the <span>resource node</span>. This led to some <span>frustration and confusion from play testers</span>.
                        <br>
                        The <span>reason</span> for this inconsistency was <span>other objects blocking the raycast</span> from the cursor.
                        <br>
                        When rewriting the click interact, I <span>added a object channel for Interact</span>, which helped reduce the inconsistency.

                            To improve the user experience, I added more <span>feedback to the players actions</span>. I <span>swap the cursor icon</span> and add a <span>hover effect</span> on the resource node by changing the material.
                            This makes the resource nodes feel more like <span>buttons</span> and helps <span>inform that the player should click on it</span>.
                            <br><br>
                            The resource nodes were sometimes <span>missed</span> so I very subtly added <span>animated arrows</span> pointing at the resource nodes.

                            The hover effects and arrows are <span>only active during nighttime</span> when they are interactable.

                    Scaling is a big part of any survival-like game. As the player gets stronger, resources get sparser and enemies tougher or increase in amount.
                    Balancing numbers in a spreadsheet is not quite my expertise or interest but I did try keeping scaling in mind when designing the games systems.
